# Shopping Cart Practice

## Version 1 - shoppingcart.py
shopping_cart.py is a python program with a single function built on a series of if/elif/else statements which allows a user to input items into a list (shopping cart), to view those items, to remove items, and ultimatley to quit the program.

## Version 2 - better_shopping_cart.py
better_shopping_cart.py has the same basic functionality as shopping_cart.py; however, this program has been created using a class with multiple methods.

This version has a required attribute, assuming an empty list, but the program generates an empty list if the attribute is not an empty list.
